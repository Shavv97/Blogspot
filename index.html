  <h2>Web3</h2>

  <p>I worked on a web3 app using Javascript and solidity. It is a social network ran on the blockchain. I didnt create the code myself but using it as a guide to help me learn is good. Getting a little more excited as time and practice continues. I even drove to Albertsons and bought five pounds of carne asada cause it was on sale for only 5$ a pound. I made some carne asada quesadillas. Overall my day was more positive than most days since december still not very positive, lets not forget that.</p>

  <p>I am debating on going and finishing my degree, I would like it and more confident in my ability to maintain focus and control thanks to my coding course. At the very least it wouldnt categorize me as a loser anymore.</p>

  <p>One thought that really stuck with me today was how its Valentines day on Monday. </p>

  <h2>I am healthy, wealthy, and thriving</h2>

  <p>I am healthy, wealthy and thriving. Not really but thats what my sticky notes say. Im taking active steps to try and improve my mood and bring opportunity to me. I have never worried about not being rich, never. Sure COVID threw my career for a ride but the greatest ideas come in the darkest of time. Let me tell you rock bottom is pretty dark. Only way is up... Hopefully. </p> 

  <p>First thing is getting out of my anxiety being out. COVID got me there. That held me back, I held me back and my ex for that matter. I will make things right, not everything I would like. But most. Cheers.</p> 

  <h2> Acceptance or denial? Both?</h2>

  <p> I tend to dream. I imagine anything it possible, people attempt to shoot me down but it hasnt happened yet. Sometimes I shoot myself down, but its neccessary. I was choosing to deny the current situation. I kept this glimmer or hope believing things could change. I couldnt accept it and I still fully dont, but I shot myself back down to reality. I am at that crossroads. I have not full accepted the reality but understand reality is not created in my head.</p>

  <P> I went on a manic bike ride to get the creative juices going, I want to take my skill set to the next level. Apply it to something bigger, something scalable. But what exaclty I need to figure out. I think I will try to sleep early tonight.</P>

  <p> </p>

  <h2>Anyone hungry?</h2>

<p>I woke up so hungry today, I havent been eating much and yesterday I didnt eat all day. You see I tend to disengage from everything when the days are bad. Well its been two. I have my moments where I see im healing, its exhausting but motivating. I smoke weed pretty dang often, even more due to COVID but its been 15 days now since. My focus has been somewhere else. MONEY SAVER. </p>

<p> Who ever is reading this is probably wondering what the heck did I do about my hunger... ADHD baby. Well I indulged on two orders of chicken alfredo from Olive Garden. I was alone and had my moments but little by little im learning to be alone, to detach places/things from my ex. If I dont I would never be happy, oh Johnny... it isnt even close to easy.</p>

<p>Lets see what the rest of the week has in store for me.</p>




  <h2>What you always deserved</h2>

  <p>Today I had this weight on my shoulders this itch. I found some inspiration, something that helped me articulate my feelings into words. This is what I should have said to my past love, I never should have needed to say this to begin with. If I would have just accepted it. Things would be different everyone. 
       A regret I need to work through and ultimately accept. She will remain anon for privacy concerns as I can imagine it is embarassing for her to admit her relationship to me. 
  </p>
    <!-- <img src="images/IMG_0511.jpeg" alt="Three floors of several brightly-colored doors with a person walking on the second floor" /> -->
  <p>Before I begin, a portion of this was something I read. Written in a way I never could. This is the apology that she should have. The apology she is owed. The apology that I wish I never needed to give.
    I learned from this and in turn I hope someone else learns before it is past time.
  </p>

    </figure> -->

  <p> I can't say I am sorry. I used that term so much it is basically useless, lacking value, garbage. 
    I hurt you, I broke you down. Your forgiveness, your patience, your acceptance was like a revolving door. Your second chances became unlimited. I became a monster when I let you continue to do this, to accept this version of me that no longer was because of my self pity and jealousy. I let you believe I would do right by you. I truly believed myself but looking back did I? Constantly throwing away your words of affirmation and reassurance to feed my desire to surpass these two men. I let it build up, and tainted you further by placing that responsibility onto you. Thats selfish, I am selfish and I chose to keep disregarding how you felt. Using you and my feelings as an excuse to make it right, was completly wrong.
  </p>

    </figure> -->
    
    <p>For 90% of our relationship you were pure, a pure soul I tainted. I felt you would help better me, make me a better person, and spend our lives together. I used you for my gain because I didnt want to lose you. As if you were some sort of object. I used you to escape reality because you were such a soft spoken and peaceful lover. You had your own personal battles but always put them second to mine. I loved you for so many reasons, Love you would be more accurate, I never gave you enough to justify loving me in return. </p>

        <figcaption>This photo well, just wonderful</figcaption>
      </figure> -->
      
      <p>When you said no, I should have listened. You were fragile, and I already played on your heart so not listening  for your consent, was enough to not deserve your forgiveness. Further more my actions that followed. I dont deserve to have access to you. I dont deserve to be apart of your life. I just want you to know I'm accountable. I am aware. I need to live with hurting you. Whats left of your pure heart will never let me forget how much I regret turning you away and turning you into someone you arent. You dont deserve that. That is my punishment. I hope you will feel secure again. I hope you are you. I wish I could be apart of that. I wish I could see the pure smile that made me so happy in the early stages of our time together. Not the one that covered your pain like a mask.  </p>

        <p> I am sad. I have been since the day you left. I did not go that day not because I didnt care but because I couldnt bring myself to be near you, because of my shame. I miss you and love you, my feelings havent just disappeared. That is irrelevant now. Why didnt I just accept her words? She cried in the bed once in Irvine because she felt so guilty for hurting me and I am just realizing this now. Why? I looked at your social media everyday. I went on the dating apps to see you on there. Thats how disconnected I was from reality, so focused on beating some guys and pouring that to you. So much so I tore you away from your owm individuality, controlling you. I had hope. At times I wake up and fight the urge to reach out, I hope for another message, I think about you at least once. I read the last message you sent me to remind myself you are fine without me. You moved on fast,and your only feelings towards me only reflect hatred. I wish things would change. I wish I could be in your presence. All I have is a sweater. The greatest of all is not being able to talk to you again. I wanted so bad to be good enough. Never want you to look at them, to make you more happy than they ever could and now I am the one blocked from your life. My desire to pull you away from them now turned to them having more access than ever. The irony</p>

          <p> No apology is good enough, almost no action good enough. You are strong, beaufitul, full of life,and pure. I should have been saying this our entire relationship. You always said you didnt know if you would make it past your 20's. You have so much to look forward to. Im proud of you tackling school like the person you are. I wish our paths could cross again and things would be great. I was always a dreamer. I will remember the good times and live with the bad. You said I was your greatest regret. You were my greatest achievement, my actions are my regret. </p>

           <p> Love,
            The one who hurt you.
          </p>

          <p>What she always deserved.</p>

             <h2> Passion or wasting time? </h2>

            <p>I am getting pretty good at coding, I am grasping the concept. I even have a potential client for an NFT project with a neighbor of mine. Not bad for a scrub. My dilemma is that I still dont know if I am doing this as a passion or to pass the time and get my mind off more taxing thoughts? Maybe it is just a whole bunch of self doubt. Either way, I need to figure it out. </p>

            <p>I am still healing from alot, still relfecting and decided to visit a new therapist. I feel like I am making progress finally after our 4th appointment. My nights consist of overthinking and intrusive thoughts. Followed by an early morning or urges to fight. See I am impulsive, I dont think things through. I big downfall of mine.</p>

            <p>I went to watch Jackass 4 today, it was nostalgic. I good way to destress even. I had one moment of sadness being alone on this outing, but I worked throught it. Will I ever out of this funk? Time will tell, all I know is I cant let it take me over.</p>

            <h2> Hello Irvine</h2>
    
              <p>Today I started packing. I am moving to Irvine in another apartment down the way. Bitter sweet, but more sweet because that apartment was apart of some of the most shameful things I have done and experienced. It also doesnt help that there was persons in the company who rightdully so despise me. Probably best I left.</p>

              <p> Its a nice place, one bedroom and more space for my dog Rocky. More expensive but anything is more expensive than what I was paying before.</p>

              <p> I came across some things that werent mine and triggered so many memories. Even the damn green tea gave me the feels. I think its about time those went back to their rightful owner. Not easy but necessary. </p>

              <p> Time to clean that shower!!!!</p>

                <h2> Ugh Weekends</h2>

                <p>I am making it a point to try and not stay in bed past 12 on the weekends. I know 12 is late but heartbreak will do that to a person. Whether I go visit family or do something alone distraction is good.</p>

                <p>They just arent the same, my person isnt there. All I do is overthink because she is living her best life, just think and think about what.. or who she is doing. Twisted I know </p>

                <p> It steak day on sundays though so thats one plus.</p>

                  <h2> to delete or not to delete</h2>
                  
                  <p>That is the question I am asking myself. I gathered the strength to ask a favor and get some personal belongings out of my hand and into the rightful owner. Was that taxing emotionally. </p>

                  <p> I have slowly been deleting photos and videos of my previous relationship. Starting with items I should not have in my possesion anymore, I have gotten to the last 12 photos. Ill keep these ones a little while longer.</p>

                  <p> I deleted the number but it doesnt matter because the thread is still there and I know it by heart. LOL. It is symbolic... you guys get it. </p>

                  <h2>She only won because  I lost </h2>

                    <!-- <figure>
                      <img src="images/IMG_9898.jpeg" alt="A motion blurred street with an in-focus taxi." />

                    </figure> -->
                    
                    <p>A person actually said that, talk about sore loser. But it made me reflect, it triggered some thoughts about myself. I basicallty lived with that mindset for 7 months because I blamed someone else for my own hurt. Slap on the head deserved here.</p>

                    <p> there is no winning or losing, everyone lost</p>

                    <h2> I can take on anything</h2>

                    <p> I woke up confident and ready to take on the world today. That was refreshing</p>

                    <p>I fed my dog, took him on a walk, did some coding, and rode the bike AGAIN. Wild.</p>

                    <p>I had an interview and I think I nailed it. We will see.</p> 
                    <p>  It felt great, for a while</p>
                    <p>Until I realized, do I even deserve to feel good? What a thought right? Guilt its a b**ch. I didnt let it stop me, im proud of that. I already started these things today so I might as well finish them. DAMAGE CONTROL.</p>
