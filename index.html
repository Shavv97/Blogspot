  <h2>What you always deserved</h2>
  <p> This is what I should have said, I never should have needed to say this to begin with. If I would have just accepted it.
       A regret I need to work through and ultimately accept. But first I want to show off the last photos remaining. I can't bring myself to remove them forever.
  </p>

  <p>Before I begin, a portion of this was something I read. Written in a way I never could. This is the apology that she should have. The apology she is owed. The apology that I wish I never needed to give.</p>

  <p> I can't say I am sorry. I used that term so much it is basically useless, lacking value, garbage. 
    I hurt you, I broke you down. Your forgiveness, your patience, your acceptance was like a revolving door. Your second chances became unlimited. I became a monster when I let you continue to do this, to accept this version of me that no longer was because of my self pity and jealousy. I let you believe I would do right by you. I truly believed myself but looking back did I? Constantly throwing away your words of affirmation and reassurance because of Peter and your FWB from college. I always told myself they must have been good if she did these things with them for so long without some sort of desire to pursue more. I never addmitted my feelings towars your FWB, why? I don't know. I let it build up. I didnt even know how he looked but all I know was  my thoughts: he satisifed your desires and you never pursued anything more. When I couldn't do that EVER. I hated them, all I wanted was to feel good enough.

    <p>For 90% of our relationship you were pure, a pure soul I tainted. I felt you would help better me, make me a better person, and spend our lives together. I used you for my gain because I didnt want to lose you. As if you were some sort of object. I used you to escape reality because you were such a soft spoken and peaceful lover. You had your own personal battles but always put them second to mine. I loved you for so many reasons, Love you would be more accurate, I never gave you enough to justify loving me in return. </p>

      <p>When you said no, I should have listened. You were fragile, and I already played on your heart so not listening your consent, was enough to not deserve your forgiveness. I dont desereve to have access to you. I dont deserve to be apart of your life. I just want you to know I'm accountable. I am aware. I need to live with hurting you. Whats left of your pure heart will never let me forget how much I regret turning you away and turning you into someone you arent. You dont deserve that. That is my punishment. I hope you will feel secure again. I hope you are you. I wish I could be apart of that. I wish I could see the pure smile that made me so happy in the early stages of our time together. Not the one that covered your pain like a mask.  </p>

        <p> My heart aches, I am sad. I have been since the day you left. I did not go that day not because I didnt care but because I couldnt bring myself to be near you, because of my shame. I miss you so much and my love has not faded. Why didnt I just accept her words? She cried in the bed once in Irvine because she felt so guilty for hurting me and I am just realizing this now. Why. Up until you  blocked me I looked at your social media everyday. Up until you blocked me I went on the dating apps to see you on there. Up until you blocked me, I had hope. Everday I wake up and fight the urge to reach out, everyday I hope for another message, everyday I think about
        you. Everyday I read the last message you sent me to remind myself you are fine without me. You moved on , you are with someone else now, your time is with them now, and your love for me is gone. I wish things would change. I wish I could see you. I wish I could hold you and cry, say I love you. But now all I have is a sweater, a sweater I need to give back eventually. That is another punishment. The greatest of all is not being your other half. </p>

            The one who hurt you.
